<h1>Language Development</h1>
<br>

<p><strong>Language development</strong> is a process starting early in human life, when a person begins to acquire language by learning it as it is spoken and by mimicry. Children's language development moves from simple to complex. Infants start without language. Yet by four months of age, babies can read lips and discriminate speech sounds. The language that infants speak is called babbling.</p>
<p>Usually, language starts off as recall of simple words without associated meaning, but as children grow, words acquire meaning, with connections between words being formed. As a person gets older, new meanings and new associations are created and vocabulary increases as more words are learned.</p>
<p>Infants use their bodies, vocal cries and other preverbal vocalizations to communicate their wants, needs and dispositions. Even though most children begin to vocalize and eventually verbalize at various ages and at different rates, they learn their first language without conscious instruction from parents or caretakers. In fact research has shown that the earliest learning begins in utero when the fetus can recognize the sounds and speech patterns of its mother's voice.</p>


<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biological_preconditions">Biological preconditions</span></h3>

<p>Linguists do not agree on the biological factors contributing to language development, however most do agree that the ability to acquire such a complicated system is unique to the human species. Furthermore, many believe that our ability to learn spoken language may have been developed through the evolutionary process and that the foundation for language may be passed down genetically. The ability to speak and understand human language requires a specific vocal apparatus as well as a nervous system with certain capabilities.</p>

<p>One hotly debated issue is whether the biological contribution includes capacities specific to language acquisition, often referred to as universal grammar. For fifty years, linguist Noam Chomsky has argued for the hypothesis that children have innate, language-specific abilities that facilitate and constrain language learning. In particular, he has proposed that humans are biologically prewired to learn language at a certain time and in a certain way, arguing that children are born with a Language Acquisition Device (LAD).</p>

<p>Other researchers, who believe that words and grammars are learned (rather than innate), have hypothesized that language learning results from general cognitive abilities and the interaction between learners and their surrounding communities. It has also recently been suggested that the relatively slow development of the prefrontal cortex in humans may be one reason that humans are able to learn language, whereas other species are not.</p>



<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_Influences">Environmental Influences</span></h3>

<p>A purely behaviorist view of language development is no longer considered a viable explanation of how children acquire language, yet a great deal of research describes ways in which a child's environmental experiences influence their language skills. Michael Tomasello stresses that young children are intensely interested in their social world and that early in their development they can understand the intentions of other people."</p>

<p>One component of the young child's linguistic environment is (child-directed speech) also known as baby talk or motherese, which is language spoken in a higher pitch than normal with simple words and sentences. Although the importance of its role in developing language has been debated, many linguists think that it may aid in capturing the infant's attention and maintaining communication</p>

<p>Adults use strategies other than child-directed speech like recasting, expanding, and labeling: <b>Recasting</b> is rephrasing something the child has said, perhaps turning it into a question or restating the child's immature utterance in the form of a fully grammatical sentence. <b>Expanding</b> is restating, in a linguistically sophisticated form, what a child has said. <b>Labeling</b> is identifying the names of objects</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_preconditions">Social preconditions</span></h3>

<p>It is crucial that children are allowed to socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, children must be in an environment that allows them to communicate socially in that language.</p>
<p>There are a few different theories as to why and how children develop language. The most popular -- and yet heavily debated-- explanation is that language is acquired through imitation. The two most accepted theories in language development are psychological and functional. Psychological explanations focus on the mental processes involved in childhood language learning. Functional explanations look at the social processes involved in learning the first language.</p>
<p>There are four main components of language:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Phonology</b> involves the rules about the structure and sequence of speech sounds.</li>
  <li><b>Semantics</b> consists of vocabulary and how concepts are expressed through words.</li>
  <li><b>Grammar</b> involves two parts. The first, <b>syntax</b>, is the rules in which words are arranged into sentences. The second, <b>morphology</b>, is the use of grammatical markers (indicating tense, active or passive voice etc.).</li>
  <li><b>Pragmatics</b> involves the rules for appropriate and effective communication. Pragmatics involves three skills:
    <ul>
      <li>using language for greeting, demanding etc.</li>
      <li>changing language for talking differently depending on who it is you are talking to</li>
      <li>following rules such as turn taking, staying on topic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Each component has its own appropriate developmental periods.</p>
