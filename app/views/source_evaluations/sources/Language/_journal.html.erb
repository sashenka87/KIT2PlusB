<h2>The Role of Home Literacy Practices in Preschool Children's Language and Emergent Literacy Skills</h2>
<br>

<p>This study examined how 4 specific measures of home literacy practices (i.e., shared book reading frequency, maternal book reading strategies, child’s enjoyment of reading, and maternal sensitivity) and a global measure of the quality and responsiveness of the home environment during the preschool years predicted children’s language and emergent literacy skills between the ages of
3 and 5 years. Study participants were 72 African American children and their mothers or primary guardians primarily from low-income families whose home literacy environment and development have been followed since infancy. Annually, between 18 months and 5 years of age, the children’s mothers were interviewed about the frequency they read to their child and how much their child enjoyed being read to, and the overall quality and responsiveness of the home environment were observed. Mothers also were observed reading to their child once a year at 2, 3, and 4 years of age, and maternal sensitivity and types of maternal book reading strategies were coded. Children’s receptive and expressive language and vocabulary were assessed annually between 3 years of age and kindergarten entry, and emergent literacy skills were assessed at 4 years and kindergarten entry. The specific home literacy practices showed moderate to large correlations with each other, and only a few significant associations with the language and literacy outcomes, after controlling for maternal education, maternal reading skills, and the child’s gender. The global measure of overall responsiveness and support of the home environment was the strongest predictor of children’s language and early literacy skills and contributed over and above the specific literacy practice measures in predicting children’s early language and literacy development.</p>

Understanding how the home literacy environment affects the acquisition of children’s later language and emergent literacy knowledge has become of increasing interest during the past three decades (Lonigan, Burgess, & Anthony, 2000; Neuman & Dickinson, 2001; Senechal & LeFevre, 2002; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Children who acquire successful initial reading skills tend to remain good readers, while children who experience difficulty in learning to read tend to continue to have problems in reading throughout the school years (Adams, 1990; Baydar, Brooks-Gunn, & Furstenberg, 1993; Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; National Research Council, 1998). Considerable research has shown children’s emergent literacy skills— the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are necessary for the development of reading and writing (Sulzby, 1989; Teale & Sulzby, 1986)—are important for later reading success (Lonigan et al., 2000; Senechal	&	LeFevre,	2002;	Storch	&	Whitehurst,	2002; Wagner et al., 1997). The experiences, attitudes, and materials pertaining to literacy that a child encounters and interacts with at home compose a child’s home literacy environment (Leseman & DeJong, 1998; Payne, Whitehurst, & Angell,	1994;	Senechal,	LeFevre,	Thomas, & Daley, 1998; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). A number of studies have reported relationships between the home literacy environment (in particular, shared book reading interactions) and children’s later language and literacy skills (DeJong & Leseman, 2001; Haden, Reese, & Fivush, 1996; Senechal & LeFevre, 2002; van Kleeck, Gillam, Hamilton, & McGrath, 1997).

  In order to understand the role of the home literacy environment in children’s later language and development, it is important to examine how specific aspects of the home literacy environment contribute to children’s later language and literacy development. This study examined the extent to which specific home literacy practices (frequency of shared book reading, maternal strategies and sensitivity during book reading, children’s interest in reading) and a global measure of the overall responsiveness of the home environment during the preschool years related to children’s language and emergent literacy skills between the ages of 3 and 5 years. Study participants were African American preschoolers primarily from low-income families whose development and family environments had been prospectively studied since infancy.

<h3>Frequency of Book Reading</h3>

<p>
  A method frequently used to assess the home literacy environment has been to obtain information from parent questionnaires about the frequency that parents read to their children (Chaney, 1994; Dickinson & DeTemple, 1998; Frijters, Barron, & Brunello, 2000; Leseman & DeJong, 1998; Payne et al., 1994). Scarborough and Dobrich (1994), in a review of re- search studies on the influence of parent–child reading experiences on the development of children’s language and literacy skills, reported that parents read to their children an average of 4.5 to 10.5 times per week and that children from low-income families are read to less frequently by their parents than children of middle socioeconomic status. In a meta-analyses published in 1994, Scarborough and Dobrich reported the frequency of shared book reading during the preschool years accounted for 7% of the variance in children’s emergent literacy skills at entry to school, 8% of the variance in children’s reading achievement from kin- dergarten through 3rd grade, and 7% of the variance in preschool children’s language development. Similarly, Bus, van IJzendoorn, and Pellegrini (1995) reported that the frequency of shared book reading during the preschool years accounted for about 8% of the variance in children’s later literacy achievement, decreasing in strength as children’s literacy skills in- creased. Although these reported associations on the impact of the frequency of shared book reading on children’s development are modest, the importance of shared reading on later literacy and language development warrants further study.

<h3>Child Interest During Book Reading</h3>

<p>
  Another potential factor that has been studied in relation to children’s development of language and literacy skills is a child’s interest in literacy activities (Frijters et al., 2000; Payne et al., 1994; Senechal, LeFevre, Hudson, & Lawson, 1996). Bus (2003) noted that the role of parents is to create an interactional context that encourages a child’s interest in reading. In their review, Scarborough and Dobrich (1994) reported that a child’s perceived interest in literacy accounted for about 14% of the variance in children’s language and literacy outcomes and that this correlation was higher than those reported for the frequency and quality measures assessed during shared book reading. More recent studies also have reported a link between children’s interest in shared book reading measured by parents’ or the child’s own rating of their interest or by children’s request to be read to (Frijters et al., 2000; Payne et al., 1994; Senechal et al., 1996) and children’s language development. The impact of children’s interest in literacy has been less studied compared to the frequency or quality of interactions during shared book reading; a child’s interest in literacy activities may be an important factor contributing to children’s language and early literacy development.

<h3>Maternal Book Reading Strategies</h3>

<p>
  In addition to studying the frequency of shared book reading, other research has focused on more qualitative measures of book reading, such as the impact of specific types of interactions that occur between parents and their children during shared book reading on children’s literacy and language development (Haden et al., 1996; Leseman & DeJong, 1998; Pellegrini, Perlmutter, Galda, & Brody, 1990; Reese & Cox, 1999; van Kleeck et al., 1997). In their meta-analyses of correlational studies, Scarborough and Dobrich (1994) reported that the quality of shared book reading during the preschool years accounted for only 4% of the variance in children’s emergent literacy skills and accounted for a smaller degree of association with children’s emergent literacy and language skills than did the frequency of shared book reading. In meta-analyses of intervention studies that attempted to modify the quality of parental book reading to increase children’s language and literacy skills, Scarborough and Dobrich reported mild associa- tions accounting for 3%–8% of the variance in children’s language and literacy skills. More recent correlational studies (Haden et al., 1996; van Kleeck et al., 1997) and intervention studies (Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998; Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994; Whitehurst, Epstein, et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988) have shown that specific parent behaviors, such as asking open-ended questions, adding information, focusing on print concepts, and eliciting abstract language, are related to children’s later language skills. A few studies have reported different strategies in book reading among low-income African American mothers and both low- and middle-income White mothers (Anderson-Yockel & Haynes, 1994; Heath, 1983). For example, Heath (1983) described how low-income African American families in comparison to White middle-class families had fewer books, read less to children, placed less emphasis on literacy-related activities, and used a different style when reading to children. Yet, Pelligrini and colleagues (1990) reported that, similar to what had been found in other studies of middle-class children, mothers of Head Start preschoolers adjusted their strategies to the cognitive demand level of their child and redirected children’s attention during joint book reading. These studies provide some support that mothers’ use of certain types of communicative behaviors during book reading interactions may facilitate children’s early language and literacy development, although their impact on children’s language and literacy development needs further study.

<h3>Overall Home Environment</h3>

<p>
  In addition to quantitative and qualitative measures of shared book reading and the home literacy environment, it is also important to examine the role of more general characteristics of the home environment in children’s development of language and literacy skills. It is possible that it is not just the frequency of reading, specific language-eliciting interactions, and social emotional processes that go on during literacy activities, but also more general dimensions in the child’s environment that have an impact on children’s language and literacy development. Thus, parents who are responsive, sensitive, and accepting of a child’s behavior, and who provide structure, organization, and a positive general emotional climate at home, along with stimulating toys and interactions, facilitate children’s language and early literacy development. Over the past 50 years, a body of research has demonstrated linkages between children’s home environment and their development (Bradley, Corwyn, Burchinal, McAdoo, & Garcia Coll, 2001; Bradley, Corwyn, McAdoo, & Garcia Coll, 2001; NICHD ECCRN, 2000, 2002). Families whose homes are rated higher on the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory (HOME; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984), a measure of the quality and quantity of stimulation and support available in the home, have been shown to score higher on later measures of language, cognitive, and academic skills (Bradley, Corwyn, Burchinal, et al., 2001; Bradley, Corwyn, McAdoo,&Garc ́ıaColl,2001).Burchinalandcolleagues (Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, & Ramey, 1997) reported that the HOME was one of the best single predictors of children’s cognitive development through 8 years of age. Whether the specific home literacy practice measures contribute over and above a global measure of the home environment to children’s language and literacy skills in the preschool years needs to be examined.
