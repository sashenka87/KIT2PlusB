<h1>A Mission to Titan, Europa, or Enceladus?</h1>
<br>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In the last four decades, flyby probes, particularly the Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini missions,
have revealed important features of the outer solar system. However, our understanding about
planetary habitability and the relationship between the evolution of planets and the evolution
of life has just beginning to be explored. In this context, the next great step in space science
will be the exploration of the outer solar system, where planetary bodies have been emerging
as potential habitable worlds. These environments provide an opportunity to extend the
concept of planetary habitability (which was previously limited to Earth-like planets) and
improve our understanding about the nature and distribution of habitable environments in the
universe. The complexity of such endeavor requires large and expensive launch vehicles, long
mission durations, highly reliable and autonomous spacecraft, and radioisotope power sources
in most cases, which demand the definition of priorities and a long term exploration strategy.
The present work discusses the astrobiological potential of planetary bodies in the outer Solar
System in order to establish priorities for future missions.
 </p>
 
 <P> <B> 1. Introduction </B> </P>
 
<p> In 1537, the age old belief in an Earth-centered solar system was radically shaken when Nicolaus Copernicus published "<i>De
 revolutionibus orbium coelestium</i>".  His 17th-century successor Galileo Galilei was the first to discover physical details
 about the individual bodies of the Solar System, advancing what became known as the
 Copernican revolution. He discovered that the Moon was cratered, that the Sun was marked
 with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it (named the Galilean moons
 in his honour). His remarkable observations were described in a book entitled "<i>Sidereus
 Nuncius</i>" (1610). Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering
 Saturn's moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn (<i>Systema Saturnium</i> 1659). And
 later, Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered four more moons of Saturn and the Cassini
 Division in Saturn's rings.</p>

 <P>In the early decades of this new age,
 solar exploration programs were dominated by scientific missions designed to simply
 discover the general nature of the Solar System, which encompassed the Mariner missions to
 Venus, Mercury, and Mars and the Pioneer (Ulivi & Harland 2007) and Voyager (Evens &
 Harland 2003) explorations of planets and satellites in the outer Solar System.
 A new phase of exploration began with the Viking missions to Mars, the Magellan mission to
 Venus (Ulivi & Harland 2008), the Galileo mission to Jupiter and its satellites (Harland
 2007), and the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and its satellites (Harland 2007). The goals
 of these missions reflected a new focus: more intensive exploration, including <i>in situ</i>
 measurements with landing and atmospheric probes.</P>
 
 <P>
 Data returned from these recent series of successful missions have initiated an exciting new
 period of exploration, as we begin the process of learning about the vast diversity of
 environments that may support life. Consequently, solar system exploration has been
 structured around the concept of habitability - the ability of a planet or moon to sustain life for
 extended periods of time or for a planetary system to host a planet or moon that can in turn
 sustain life (Rampelotto 2010a). The habitability concept provides a unifying theme for an
 exploration program, which includes research and analysis and leads to a set of exploration
 objectives.</P>
 
 <P>
 In this context, the next great step in space science will be the exploration of the outer solar
 system, where planetary bodies have been emerging as potential habitable worlds (Russell &
 Kanik 2010; Chela-Flores 2010; Schulze-Makuch 2010). These environments provide an
 opportunity to extend the concept of planetary habitability (which was previously limited to
 Earth-like planets) and improve our understanding about the nature and distribution of
 habitable environments in the universe (Lal 2010; Javaux and Dehant 2010).</P>
 
 <P>
 The complexity of such endeavor requires significant focused technology development prior
 to mission start, and extended engineering developments, as well as extensive pre-decisional
 trade studies to determine the proper balance of cost, risk, and science return. For these
 reasons, they represent major national investments that must be selected and implemented in a
 strategic manner. The present work discusses the astrobiological potential of planetary bodies
 in the outer Solar System in order to establish priorities for future missions.</P>

 <P> <B> 
 2. A Mission to Europa </B> </P>
 
 <P>
 Until recently, Europa was widely accepted as the most promising target for a future mission
 in terms of astrobiological potential (Greenberg 2005). Since the time of the Voyager, the
 existence of a water ocean below its surface ice crust has been suggested (Greenberg 2008).
 Data from the Galileo mission, which observed Europa from 1996 to 2002, indicated that such
 ocean may be warm and salty, greater by a factor of two to three than the volume of liquid
 water on Earth, what renewed the interest of the scientific community to explore this Jupiter’s
 satellite in more details (Pappalardo 2009).</P>

 <P>
 The few large impact craters point to a young surface age (Zahnle et al., 2003) and geological
 models for the formation of surface features suggest that this moon has been geologically
 active (Figueredo & Greeley 2004) or was in a recent past. Europa is unique among the large
 icy satellites because its ocean may be in direct contact with its rocky mantle beneath
 (Kuskov & Kronrod 2005). Other satellites from outer solar system such as Ganymede,
 Callisto and Titan may also have subsurface oceans; however, those liquid layers are likely
 sandwiched between two ice layers of different phases (Sohl et al. 2010). The possible deep
 ocean environment within Europa may resemble that on Earth, where hydrothermal vents on
 the ocean bottom support a surprisingly diverse suite of organisms by providing a variety of
 energy-rich chemical compounds (Chyba & Phillips 2002; Rampelotto 2010c). The main
 point of interest is currently the thickness of the ice layer that exists on top of the aqueous
 ocean. Although it has been estimated to be around 20-50km, the thickness remains unknown,
 since there is no consensus among model results (Billings & Kattenhorn 2005; Ruiz et al.
 2007). This topic is of great importance for astrobiology because it determines the extent of
 material exchange from the surface to the subsurface ocean and vice-versa. A thin ice crust
 permits direct communication of the ocean material with the surface, whereas a thick ice crust
 results in an ocean largely isolated from the surface. The latter possibility may not maintain a
 chemically and energetically rich environment, and consequently may not support living
 systems. Cratering and tectonic features on Europa raise the possibility that material from the
 deep ocean has been deposited on the surface (Kattenhorn 2009). However, it is important to
 note that the Europa surface is exposed to the harshest radiation environment in the Solar
 System since this planetary body presents a very tenuous atmosphere (Paranicas et al. 2007).
 This very high level of radiation from high-energy charged particles trapped in Jupiter’s
 magnetosphere can dissociate any organic molecules on the surface and may have a similar
 effect on prebiotic chemistry coming from the interior. Hence, the presence of biosignatures
 on the surface of this moon seems not feasible, or at least, their concentration may be very
 low.</P>

<P>
 Therefore, the astrobiological interest on Europa lies in the possible existence of life inside
 the internal ocean and its biosignatures in a subsurface environment (Chyba & Phillips 2001;
 Marion et al. 2003; Abbas & Schulze-Makuch 2008). Before sending a lander probe or
 penetrator to Europa, it is necessary to define astrobiological interesting landing sites, where
 liquid water from the ocean could have recently reached the surface or near surface. Whether
 large cracks represent these locals remains controversial and it is still unclear how to interpret
 features on Europa’s surface (Spencer et al. 2006). On the basis of current knowledge, it is
 difficult to determine with confidence where the potential landing sites may be. It will be first
 necessary to analyze results especially from the thickness of the ice crust and high resolution
 images from geological features, which means that sending in situ instruments before a better
 understanding of Europa may be premature and highly risky.</P>
 
 <P>
 In this context, the proposed next flagship mission to Europa would be an orbiter restricted to
 producing images in various wavelengths as proposed to the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), the
 current NASA/ESA concept to explore Europa (Clark et al. 2010). Though new technology
 developments are not required, it is necessary to adapt current instrument designs into a single
 orbited able to perform within a harsh radiation environment. These challenges result in a
 mission launch date no earlier than 2020 with Europa orbital insertion around 2028. The data
 would bring some closure to arguments about the thickness of the crust and the existence of
 an aqueous internal ocean and could identify places where the subsurface can be more easily
 accessed. However, in the context of astrobiology, such orbiter would be only the precursor to
 the next mission - probes able to access the subsurface/internal ocean and provide in situ life
 signal measurements. Considering the complexity and cost for a mission to the outer solar
 system and the arguments discussed previously, such mission to detect life or biosignatures on
 Europa may probably take many decades to happen.</P>

 <P> <B> 
 3. A Mission to Ganymede </B> </P>

  <P>The JEO mission is one component of the NASA/ESA Europa Jupiter System Mission (ESJM
  ESA working title: Laplace). The European-led component of ESJM is an orbiter to
 Ganymede (Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter - JGO) which has been considered a high priority
 target for astrobiology (Blanc et al. 2009). However, the habitability of this planetary body is
 based just on the presence of water. Considering that the subsurface ocean in this satellite is
 probably sandwiched between two layers of ice and that the subsurface ice crust may have
 around (or more than) 100km, the existence of sources capable of sustaining chemical
 complexity as well as effective sources of energy are highly improbable (Rampelotto 2010b).
 For these reasons, Ganymede seems not to be able to sustain life, and consequently, although
 not discarded, its astrobiological potential remains quite low.</P>
 
 <P> <B> 4. A Mission to Titan </B> <P>

   <P>
 Titan, as revealed by Cassini-Huygens mission, is a complex world with diverse geophysical
 and atmospheric processes offering many similarities with the primitive Earth (Coustenis &
 Taylor 2008). In situ measurements indicate the presence of methane rain on Titan (Tokano et
 al. 2006; Lunine & Atreya 2008) and liquid methane-ethane lakes on Titan’s geologically
 active surface have been confirmed by the Cassini-Huygens mission (Stofan et al. 2007).</P>
 
 <P>
 Despite its frigid temperature, the coupled atmosphere/surface Titan system is an active
 laboratory for synthesis of complex organic compounds. The abundance of methane and its
 organic products in the atmosphere, seas and dunes exceeds by more than an order of
 magnitude the carbon inventory in the Earth’s ocean, biosphere and fossil fuel reservoirs
 (Lorenz & Lunine 2009).</P>
 
 <P>
 The initial step of this chemistry is relatively well understood (Lorenz & Mitton 2010). It
 starts with the dissociation of N2 and CH4 through electron and photon impacts. In these
 processes C2H2 and HCN play a key role (Imanaka et al. 2010). These key molecules are
 formed in the high atmosphere. They then diffuse down to the lower levels where they allow
 the formation of high molecular weight hydrocarbons and nitriles as well as complex organic
 aerosols (Waite et al. 2009). The molecular composition of these aerosols (also called tholins)
 has still to be determined. The current understanding of Titan’s organic chemistry has been
 simulated successfully in the laboratory. These experiments have been produced all types of
 organic species in the gas phase already detected in Titan’s atmosphere, with relative
 concentration for most of them (Raulin 2005). Moreover, it is very likely that Titan’s organic
 chemistry may not only be more complex in the atmosphere (up to and certainly beyond C7
 hydrocarbons that the Cassini mass spectrometer was able to measure), but also in the
 hydrocarbon lakes (Brown & Lebreton 2009). The fraction of tholins deposited on Titan’s
 surface may be able to take the next evolutionary step by reacting with transient exposures of
 liquid water provoked by impact melt and cryovolcanism. In fact, a variety of cryovolcanic
 surface features can be attributed to Titan’s recent internal activity (Lopes 2007), e.g. the 180
 km structure Ganesa Macula. Such geological structures would indeed permit aqueous
 chemistry to occur for centuries or longer (Neish et al., 2006). In addition, the possible
 presence of a water-ammonia ocean in the depths of Titan, as expected from models of its
 internal structure (Tobie et al., 2005; Lorenz et al. 2008), may also provide an efficient way to
 convert simple organics into complex molecules (Fortes, 2000). The temperature and pH
 dependence of the rates and yields of these reactions have been studied in laboratory (Neish et
 al. 2009). Oxygen incorporation into organic aerosols is remarkably fast, both in pure water
 and 13 wt. % ammonia-water. The reactions occur over time scales as short as days and
 weeks even at temperatures as low as 253 K, producing a product that is high percent oxygen
 by mass (Neish et al. 2008). These results indicate that even with an atmosphere free of
 oxygen, the production of compounds with oxygen in its molecular structure is possible on
 Titan (Neish et al. 2010). Additional laboratory experiments have shown that the interaction
 of water with organic aerosols can yield amino acids in substantial amounts (~ 1% by mass)
 (McDonald et al. 1994). Simpler nitriles have been detected in the gas phase on Titan, along
 with HC3N and possibly C4N2 in the solid phase (Anderson et al. 2009). These nitriles are
 deposited as condensate on the surface and also can react to form astrobiologically interesting
 material in water. Consequently, although the extent to which present-day Titan resembles the
 prebiotic Earth is not clear, Titan may provide key insights into planetary organic chemistry,
 and possibly insights into chemistry leading to life.</P>


<P>
 More exotic prebiotic-like processes, involving a non-aqueous solvent, may be occurring
 today on Titan (Rampelotto 2010d). The most abundant volatile organic product of Titan’s
 atmospheric chemistry is ethane which accumulates at the surface, in particular in the polar
 lakes discovered by Cassini (Stofan et al. 2007; Brown et al. 2008). These surface liquid
 bodies provide an environment where organics can accumulate and chemically differentiate
 (Raulin 2008). The possibility that this active fluid of methane and ethane on Titan could be a
 solvent, in which life operates, has been suggested by several authors (Baross et al. 2007). If
 living systems are flourishing in the ethane/methane lakes and consuming the hydrocarbons
 produced in the atmosphere, they would be widespread on the surface of Titan and have a
 global effect on the environment. In this case, some years ago, a study suggested a type of life
 on Titan, called methanogens (McKay & Smith 2005). According to the researches,
 microorganisms could react H<sub>2</sub> with organic material (like acetylene or ethane) to derive
 energy. The waste product in this case would be CH<sub>4</sub>. The key conclusion of that study was
 "The results of the recent Huygens probe could indicate the presence of such life by
 anomalous depletions of acetylene and ethane as well as hydrogen at the surface"(McKay &
 Smith 2005). Recent studies seem to corroborate with this hypothesis. Based on a computer
 calculation, one of these studies predicts a strong flux of hydrogen into the Titan’s surface
 (Strobel 2010) and another paper reported depletions of acetylene at the surface (Clark et al.
 2010). Moreover, it is known that ethane on the surface is lower than expected, while Ch4 is
 abundant on Titan (Rampelotto 2010a). Although these results are not evidence of life, they
 are extremely interesting.</P>


 <P>
 Altogether, the arguments presented in this section indicate the potential of Titan for science
 and especially for astrobiological studies. It is a promising field of research with the potential
 to improve our knowledge in a full range of planetary science disciplines including geology,
 geophysics, chemistry, atmospheres and related areas. In addition, it may represent a local to
 understand prebiotic process of "life as we know it" as well as to search for exotic forms of
 life. Furthermore, such studies may improve the design of life-detection experiments on
 exoplanets, since titan-like planets may be common in the universe. Indeed, planets around
 the most common stellar type, the cool M dwarfs, at the distance of the Earth from the Sun
 will be as cold as Titan (Lunine 2009).</P>
 
 <P>
 For these reasons, Titan is the highest priority for astrobiological studies in the solar system.
 Exploration of this complex world, with diverse geophysical and atmospheric processes, will
 require long-term orbiting and <i>in situ</i> exploration, at a season different than Cassini- Huygens.
 The primary architecture of such mission, the Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM), has
 already been designed, reviewed and improved (TSSM Final Report 2009; Coustenis et al.
 2009). While the Titan-dedicated orbiter would provides a set of mapping and profiling
 instruments for the surface, atmosphere, and ionosphere, a comprehensive <i>in situ</i> investigation
 would be accomplished via a hot-air balloon, which has been carefully studied by U.S. and
 European space agencies, for surface high resolution imaging and atmospheric measurements,
 and a probe with the capability to land on the surface of a hydrocarbon lake to study its
 composition and search for potential exotic forms of life.</P>
 
 
 <P><B> 5. A Mission to Enceladus </B> </P>
 
 <P>
 Although the main focus of TSSM will be Titan, this Flagship Mission would perform
 several flybys on Enceladus, a Saturn’s satellite that has attracted considerable attention from
 the scientific community when the Cassini spacecraft identified a water plume venting from
 near its south polar area (Porco et al. 2006). The source is a series of parallel fissures,
 nicknamed the "tiger stripes", which propels the plumes 80 km above the surface. The water
 ice particles present in the plumes appear to be the source of the E ring of Saturn (Kempf et
 al. 2010) indicating that the activity has been occurring for a considerable period of time.
 Such cryovolcanic activity suggests that there is ample heat available to drive chemistry in
 Enceladus’ interior (Matson et al. 2007; Abramov & Spencer 2009), and the regions around
 the fissures of these cryo-volcanoes have been extensively resurfaced through time (Schenk et
 al. 2009; Helfenstein 2010). Although the physical mechanism for production of the heat is
 being debated, there is no question that a significant and persistent heat source is present
 (Ingersoll et al. 2009).</P>

 <P>
 The observed chemistry of Enceladus is remarkable in the context of astrobiology. Organics,
 methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and possibly several nitrogen species have been
 observed on the surface or in the plume material (Waite et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2006;
 Hedman et al. 2009). Part of the material ejected may return and deposit on the surface (Tobie
 et al. 2010). Since the Enceladus’ surface may not be heavily exposed to radiation, the
 compound deposited on the surface may remain unaltered and easily detected by an orbiter.
 The probable presence of nitrogen and carbon-based compounds in the plume and organics
 along the tiger stripes suggests that the prebiotic synthesis of amino acids could take place in
 Enceladus’ interior. The main question regarding this moon is the presence of a subsurface
 liquid layer. In this quest, recent studies have provided support that Enceladus has a
 subsurface ocean, either global or possibly localized (Collins and Goodman 2007; Tyler
 2009), beneath an ice shell between 80 to 100 km thick. The possibility that this subsurface
 ocean may be in contact with a rocky core of radius ~ 150-160 km has been also suggested
 (Barr and McKinnon 2007; Schubert et al. 2007). Such rocky/water contact may provide a
 warm and chemically rich environment that may facilitate complex organic chemistry and
 biological processes in a similar way proposed to Europa (Parkinson et al. 2007). Unlike the
 icy Galilean satellites, whose geological activity may have occurred millions of years ago,
 Enceladus is active today and presents a clear geochemical cycle (Spencer et al. 2009).
 The existence of a complex chemistry in an aqueous solvent, sustained by cryovolcanic
 activity and tectonic resurfacing, associated with a persistent source of free energy, provides
 the fundamental requirements for the origin and persistence of life on Enceladus (McKay et
 al. 2006; Parkinson et al. 2006). For these reasons, Enceladus has been ranked as the second
 most promising target in the outer solar system for astrobiological studies, ahead of the
 Galilean satellites (Rampelotto 2010b).</P>
 
 <P>
 What is really interesting in the case of Enceladus is that the search for life on it may not
 require a lander or ice penetrator. The plume provides an opportunity to sample its deep
 interior. Hence, an orbiter properly equipped will be able to collect or analyze samples from
 the plumes in the search for biosignatures. The capacity of the TSSM will greatly exceed that
 of Cassini by providing superior mass spectroscopy of the Enceladus plume, higher resolution
 infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the surface, and radar altimetry of the active regions at
 the South Pole. Altogether, these measurements would give a complete understanding about
 the habitability of Enceladus.</P>

 <P><B> 6. Concluding Remarks </B> <P>
<P>
 The present work discussed the astrobiological potential of planetary bodies in the outer Solar
 System in order to establish priorities for future missions. According to the arguments
 previously pointed out, Titan and Enceladus represent the highest priorities for future
 missions in the context of astrobiology. Considering the proximity of these planetary bodies, a
 single Flagship Mission for both targets would be the best option. The TSSM is clearly justified and should be performed in terms of its current concept. The complexity of this endeavor poses technical
 challenges requiring additional studies and technology development, specially improved
 technology for the balloon and lake lander. However, considering the fundamental
 contribution to science, a mission to Titan is worthy of all the financial and technical support
 that will be necessary. It may be succeeded worldwide, with the participation of more
 research institutes and universities with scientific and technological experience in space
 exploration.</P>
 <P>
 The EJSM is not justified in terms of its main scientific goal (<i>The emergence of habitable
 worlds around gas giants</i>) since Ganymede has low priority in terms of astrobiological
 potential. Furthermore, the current concept of the EJSM will not be able to fully address the
 habitability of Europa, which may take many decades to happen. For these reasons, an
 alternative architecture for the EJSM, with focus on Europa and including in situ
 instrumentation, should be studied.</P>
