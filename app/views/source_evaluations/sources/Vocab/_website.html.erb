<h1>Toddler milestone: Talking</h1>
<br>

<p>Talking and understanding speech go hand in hand. By listening to others, your child learns what words sound like and how to put a sentence together.</p>
<p>As a baby, she discovered first how to make sounds, then how to make those sounds into real words ("mama" and "dada" may have slipped out as early as 4 or 5 months). By the time she was a year old, she was trying to imitate the sounds around her (though you probably heard her babbling away in a language that only she could understand).</p>

<p>Now comes a period of extraordinary growth, as your toddler goes from speaking a few simple words to asking questions, giving directions, and even telling you stories she's made up.</p> 

<h3>When and how it develops</h3>

<p>Here's a general idea of how you can expect your toddler's verbal skills to progress. Keep in mind that every child is different. Children pick up language in stages, and kids may reach those stages at different times. If your child varies somewhat from these general guidelines, don't worry. (If he's being raised in a bilingual environment, the number of words he can speak may be split between the two languages he's learning.)</p><p><strong>12 to 18 months</strong><br />By his first birthday, your child will probably begin to use one or two words meaningfully. Over the next few months, he'll try to copy words, and you may hear him babbling away as if he's having a real conversation. He'll even practice speech sounds, raising his tone when asking a question. He might say "Up-py?" when asking to be carried, for example..</p> 

<h3>Milestones</h3> <p>Record the moments that matter in your toddler's amazing development</a>.</p> 

<p>Your toddler is learning the power of talking as a means of communicating his needs. Until he learns more words to get his ideas and desires across, he'll probably combine his speech with gestures to show what he wants. He'll reach his arms toward his favorite toy, for example, and say "ball."</p><p>In fact, some toddlers develop a whole sign language of gestures to communicate with their parents. Your child might put his fingers to his lips when he wants food, for example, or pound on the table when he's frustrated.</p><p>Don't worry if he struggles to get his meaning across now and then. This frustration is actually a healthy sign that he's trying hard to communicate and cares whether you understand him.</p><p>By 18 months, your toddler will probably start making many common consonant sounds, such as t, d, n, w, and h. Learning to make these sounds is a watershed event, one that leads to the rapid vocabulary spurt that most children go through at this stage. Don't expect to hear all these sounds in actual words yet. But you may hear him repeating them when he's alone in his crib or playing with his toys.</p><p><strong>19 to 24 months</strong><br />Your child now understands simple commands and questions. Each month he'll add more words to his vocabulary. Many of these words will be nouns that designate objects in his daily life, such as "spoon" and "car."</p><p>During this phase your child may begin stringing two words together, making basic sentences such as "Carry me." Since his grammar skills are still undeveloped, you'll often hear odd constructions such as "Me go."</p><p>He's understood for some time that he needs language, and he'll attempt to name new objects as he observes the world around him. He may overextend the words he already knows, though, so that all new animals are called "dogs," for example.</p><p>Starting around his second birthday, your child will begin using simple two- to four-word sentences and singing simple tunes. As his sense of self matures, he'll use "me" to refer to himself, and he's likely to tell you what he likes and doesn't, what he thinks, and what he feels.</p><p>You may also hear him say, "David want juice" or "Baby throw," for instance. (Pronouns are tricky, so you may notice him avoiding them.)</p><p><strong>25 to 30 months</strong><br />Now that he has a bigger vocabulary, your toddler will begin to experiment with sound levels. For a while he may yell when he means to speak normally and whisper softly when answering a question, but he'll find the appropriate volume soon enough.</p><p>He's also starting to get the hang of pronouns, such as "I," "me," and "you." Between ages 2 and 3, his working vocabulary will grow to 200 words or more. He'll string nouns and verbs together to form complete but simple sentences, such as "I eat now."</p><p>He'll even get the hang of speaking about events that happened in the past. He may not quite understand the particulars of the past tense or plurals, though, so you'll hear him say things like "I runned" or "I swimmed," or "mouses" instead of "mice." Sure, it's cute, but it also shows that he's picking up on the basic rules of grammar (that you add a d sound to a word if it happened yesterday, for example, and an s sound to make things plural).</p><p>At this age, your child will start answering simple questions, such as "Do you want a snack?" and "Where are your shoes?" If you notice that he doesn't use two-word phrases, consistently echoes your familiar expressions, or doesn't respond to his name, bring it up with your child's doctor. Such behavior can be an early sign of a developmental delay.</p>
