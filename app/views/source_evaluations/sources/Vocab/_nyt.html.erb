<h1>Child Development: Language Takes on New Significance</h1>
<br>

<p>To fill this gap in the care of well babies, pediatric researchers at the Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children in Baltimore have developed a simple screening test to help physicians detect lags in language development, sometimes months before babies say their first real word, phrase or sentence.</p><p>The researchers, Arnold J. Capute, Bruce K. Shapiro and Frederick B. Palmer, all physicians and associate professors of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, say the test can help to call attention to developmental problems like communication, hearing and learning disorders, as well as aid in the assessment of more severe problems like cerebral palsy, mental retardation and autism, that might not otherwise be noticed and treated until the child is much older.</p><p>Experts in language and child development applauded the new test, dubbed Clams, for Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale. The developers say the test, which has been fully standardized and validated, has already atttracted the interest of pediatricians as far away as Australia. They describe it and its potential uses in the current issue of the professional magazine, Contemporary Pediatrics. While widely used tests of child development explore some aspects of language, they focus primarily on visual/motor skills. Clams is one of the first comprehensive, systematic assessments devoted to language development.</p><p>To be sure, the ages and stages of language development, like the development of motor skills and physical growth, vary among individual babies. And boys are much more likely than girls to lag in their language development. But the Clams test can help physicians determine from parents and from the baby how closely a child's prelinguistic and language development resembles that of other children who are the same age.</p><p>For example, according to the Clams assessment, a one-week-old baby typically shows some response to sound, a four-month-old turns toward a voice, a six-month-old babbles and a nine-month-old understands the word "no." By 14 months, a baby typically says three words and can respond to a simple verbal command. By 21 months, the average child's vocabulary has grown to 50 words and by age 3 to 250 words plus sentences of three words or more. A Void in Training</p><p>Currently, experts said, few physicians who care for babies are trained to detect delays in language development. When parents bring language delays to the doctor's attention, the typical response is "Don't worry, he'll grow out of it."</p>
